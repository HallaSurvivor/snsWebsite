          Throughout Scotch’n’Soda’s early years, shows were performed, managed, and written entirely by students. Today, Workshopping embraces S’n’S’s origins by facilitating the creation of original student works. Workshopping hosts bimonthly lectures to build a ‘toolkit’ of skills for newbie writers, in addition to office hours to chat freely about projects and ideas. This sub-troupe also hosts staged readings of new plays and musicals, as well as oldies written by S’n’S alumni. We welcome writers of all experience levels! Find us on Facebook @snsworkshopping.
